# 💻 Soufian Khennousse  
Software Engineer • Cloud Support (AWS Fundamentals) • Debugging & RCA

I’m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience in troubleshooting distributed systems, analyzing logs, and performing root-cause analysis across microservice-based architectures.  
My background spans enterprise environments at Live Reply and Deloitte, where I worked on debugging CI/CD pipelines, containerized services, and developing internal tooling to reduce manual effort.

Currently advancing my cloud expertise with AWS (Cloud Practitioner scheduled for Dec 2025), while deepening my knowledge in Linux, networking (DNS, TCP/IP, OSI), and observability — all of which are core to Cloud Support Engineering.
